Open TCG, is a trading card game that utilizes a copyleft license that assures a truly community driven collaborative game development environment. Whew!! That was a mouthfull. In concideration to the outlined license, you may remix and redistribute the game for free but you can't sell it without my permission. Furthurmore the license only permits usage in the format and medium that I share it in or dictate otherwise. e.g. I share it in PDF format but explicitly state to print it for playability.
